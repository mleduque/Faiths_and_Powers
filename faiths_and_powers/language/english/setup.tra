Though <PRO_HESHE> is both protector and healer, <PRO_HESHE> is not purely defensive-when enemies threaten, the Cleric is well suited to challenge them on their own ground and destroy them.

CLASS FEATURES:

- May wear helmets.
- May wear up to Chain Mail armor.
- Deity Selection: All clerics must select a deity.  Deity selection determines sphere access, granted powers, and other bonuses.
- May become Proficient (one slot) with the short sword, Dagger, War Hammer, Club, Spear, Flail, Mace, Quarterstaff, Crossbow, Dart, Sling, or any fighting style.
- May Turn Undead.
- May cast priest spells, but is limited to universal spells until <PRO_HESHE> selects <PRO_HISHER> deity.

@10022 = ~Mage / Priest~
@10025 = ~MAGE/PRIEST: This character can use the abilities of a Priest and a Mage, though weapons are restricted to only those allowed by the Priest's ethos, and Mage spells cannot be cast while wearing armor.

Gnomes can choose this multi-class, but become Cleric/Illusionists by default. Gnomes are the only race that can combine a specialist Mage class in a multi-class.~

@20001 = ~ur-priest~
@20002 = ~Ur-Priest~
@20003 = ~UR-PRIEST: Ur-Priests are heretical practitioners that have found a way to wrest divine power from the gods with the use of ancient and forbidden rituals.  As might be expected, this behavior is frowned upon by the gods, and Ur-Priests have to keep their profession secret or risk persecution or worse.

Advantages:
- Sphere Access: Very high access.  The Ur-Priest gains major access to all spheres except the life, benediction, plant, animal and light spheres.
- Sap the Spirit: Ur-Priests can use the same techniques to drain living beings of their divine essence in much the same way they do so from the gods; though, of course, mortals do not have much of a divine essence, and so the benefits of this ability are limited.
This ability can be used once per day at fifth level.  The Ur-Priest can use Sap the Spirit an additional time per day at levels 10, 15 and 20.

SAP THE SPIRIT: This ability deals 1d4 magic damage to a living target per 4 levels of the Ur-Priest (2d4 at 5th level; maximum 6d4 at 20th level).
Beginning at 5th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> casts priest spells at +1 level for 5 rounds.  
At 10th level, if the Ur-Priest kills a target with this ability, <PRO_HESHE> also gains the benefits of the spell, Wondrous Recall.

Disadvantages:
- Cannot Turn Undead
- The rituals tax the Ur-Priest, making them more vulnerable to the effects of disease and magic.  They gain a -2 penalty to save vs. death and spells.

Deity access: None, despises the gods.

Restrictions: Cannot be of a good or lawful alignment~

@20004 = ~Sap the Spirit~

@20101 = ~dawnbringer of lathander~
@20102 = ~Dawnbringer of Lathander~
@20103 = ~DAWNBRINGER OF LATHANDER: Dawnbringers are the representatives of Lathander, a widely worshiped deity of birth, renewal, health, and the dawn. Dawnbringers are especially vigilant foes of the undead, which they see as a plague upon the living, corrupting the life that is the gift of Lathander. They look to cleanse the world with Lathander's light, eradicating any undead with its purifying rays.

Advantages:
- Turns undead as a cleric four levels higher than their current level.
- Can cast Boon of Lathander as a special ability once per day. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

BOON OF LATHANDER: This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It gives the caster a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls, a +1 bonus to all Saving Throws, and 1 extra attack per round. It also protects the caster from level drain.

- Can cast False Dawn as a special ability once per day at 9th level. The Dawnbringer gains an additional use at levels 20 and 30. The ability functions as the cleric spell of the same name.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Any good, or lawful neutral.
~
@20105 = ~False Dawn
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

False Dawn calls into existence a bright reddish light, as if a sunrise were occurring, within the area of effect. All undead creatures within the area suffer 6d6 points of fire damage and are blinded on the round after the false dawn appears. There is no Saving Throw.
~
@20108  = ~False Dawn~
//
//    CLERIC OF TORM
//
@20201 = ~hand of torm~
@20202 = ~Hand of Torm~
@20203 = ~HAND OF TORM: Hands seek to emulate their deity Torm, who is known for his steadfast loyalty and dedication to all that is good.  While a great many of his worshipers are Champions (known as Paladins or Holy Champions of Torm), as Torm is the patron of Paladinhood, Hands are no less fierce and loyal to the cause of their god (if slightly less martial).

Advantages:
- Hands are special among clerics in that they gain focus in the protection sphere.
- Hands can cast Command as a spell like ability once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability an additional time at levels 5, 10, 15, and 20.
- Hands are able to gain proficiency in any weapon or fighting style.  They can gain 2 pips in sword and shield fighting style.
- At 3rd level, a hand can cast detect evil as a spell like ability, once per day.  They gain an additional use of this ability at levels 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19.
- At 4th level, a hand can cast protection from evil as a spell like ability once per day.  They can use this ability an additional time at levels 8, 12, 16 and 20.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: Lawful good, lawful neutral, or neutral good only.
~

@20501  = ~luckrider of tymora~
@20502  = ~Luckrider of Tymora~
@20503  = ~LUCKRIDER OF TYMORA: Also known as Lady Luck, Tymora is the goddess of good fortune. The sect of her clerics known as Luckriders eat, drink, and sleep luck. Confident to the point of cockiness, they enter battle recklessly, throwing caution to the wind and trusting in fate. Considering how many adventurers perish despite crafting meticulous strategies and plans, this is not a ridiculous position.
 
Advantages:
- Luckriders are innately lucky, receiving the effects of the Luck spell permanently.
- May cast an area-of-effect "Tymora's Luck" spell innately once per day, and once more for each 5 levels of experience gained.

TYMORA'S LUCK: The allies of this spellcaster gain extraordinary luck for the next 1 turn, receiving a +1 bonus to their saving throws, attack rolls, and minimum damage/healing rolls as well as +5% to all thieving skills. Furthermore, damage dice for all effects outside a weapon's base damage is reduced by 1. Finally, spells that offer saving throws to enemies are more likely to be effective: a spell that usually offers a saving throw with no penalty will instead offer a saving throw with a -2 penalty.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: may not be Lawful or Evil.

// ... cleric of helm:
//
@20801 = ~watcher of helm~
@20802 = ~Watcher of Helm~
@20803 = ~WATCHER OF HELM: Like their deity, Watchers of Helm are stern, dedicated, and loyal, perhaps to a fault.  Helm teaches that the right path is not always obvious, but the surest way to the right path is through the execution of duty.  As such, watchers of helm strive to do what they must despite the consequences, to themselves or even to others.  While others may suggest that this supposed 'dedication' is nothing more than a fetish, the watcher has no time for such nonsense. They do not have the idle time to question; it is their duty to be ever alert for possible threats to cosmic order.   

Advantages:
- Watchers automatically gain a proficiency point in bastard swords, Helm's favored weapon.  Fighter clerics do not get this bonus, but they are able to gain mastery with the bastard sword.
- Heightened Awareness: +1 bonus to AC and +2 bonus to save vs breath
- Can cast Helm's eye as a special ability once per day at 9th level.  The watcher gains an additional use at levels 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19. Helm's eye is equivalent to the wizard spell, wizard eye.
- Can cast Seeking Sword as a special ability once per day.  The Watcher gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

SEEKING SWORD: This spell creates a sword in the Cleric's hand that cannot be dropped or unequipped. The sword is enchanted as a +4 weapon and provides a +4 THAC0 bonus, but no damage bonus. It deals 2d4 damage to any target it hits. The weapon sets the Cleric's number of attacks per round to 3 and lasts for 1 round per level. While it is equipped, the wielder cannot cast further spells.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May be Lawful Good, Lawful Neutral, or True Neutral.
~
@20806 = ~Helm's Eye~
@20807 = ~Helm's Eye

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is employed, the priest creates an invisible sensory organ that sends him visual information. Helm's Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of Helm's Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the caster or the eye ends the spell.

//
// ... cleric of KELEMVOR:
//
@20901 = ~doomguide of kelemvor~
@20902 = ~Doomguide of Kelemvor~
@20903 = ~DOOMGUIDE OF KELEMVOR: Kelemvor is the most recent god of death.  He has proven to be quite different from Mykrul, the former god of death.  In particular, while the latter encouraged the creation of undead monstrosities, Kelemvor charges his clergy to actively destroy undead, seeing their existence as an unnatural perversion of the order of life and death.  As such, his clergy have become particularly talented undead slayers.

Advantages:
- Doomguides turn undead at 4 levels higher than a cleric of their level.
- +4 to saves against death
- At 7th level, the doomguide is protected as if with the Death Ward spell.  
- At 11th level, the doomguide is protected as if with the Negative Plane Protection spell.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May not be evil or chaotic.
~
//
// ... cleric of tempus:
//
@21001 = ~battleguard of tempus~
@21002 = ~Battleguard of Tempus~
@21003 = ~BATTLEGUARD OF TEMPUS:  Tempus, also known as the Lord of Battles or the Foehammer, is random in his favors, yet his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus may be on an army's side one day and against them the next; such is the nature of war. Tempuran clergy can be found on both sides of a conflict, as none can ever truly know whom the war god will favor.

Advantages:
- Battleguards can be proficient with any weapon
- Battleguards gain a +1 bonus to damage with any melee weapon.
- Incite Rage: Battleguards can incite a berserker rage beginning at level 5, and again at levels 10, 15 and 20.  This ability is like the berserkers enrage, except that <PRO_HESHE> can incite this rage in <PRO_HIMHER>self or in others.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: No alignment restrictions.
~
@21004 = ~Incite Rage~
@21006 = ~Incite Rage

The character can incite range in <PRO_HIMHER>self or another. While enraged, the character gains a bonus of +2 to <PRO_HISHER> attack and damage rolls as well as to <PRO_HISHER> Armor Class, and becomes immune to charm, confusion, fear, feeblemind, hold, imprisonment, level drain, maze, stun, and sleep. The character also gains 15 temporary Hit Points, which are taken away at the end of the berserk spree (possibly knocking the character unconscious).

After the effects end, the character becomes winded, suffering a -2 penalty to Armor Class, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls.~

// ... cleric of leira:
//
@21201  = ~mistwalker of leira~
@21202  = ~Mistwalker of Leira~
@21203  = ~MISTWALKER OF LEIRA: Leira is the goddess of deception and illusion. She was supposedly slain under mysterious circumstances during the Avatar crisis, but at least one sect of her worshippers, the Mistwalkers, continue to receive divine power. Lies are their currency, illusion is their tool.
 
Advantages:
- May use the "Leira's Double" ability once every 5 rounds. Often used in emergencies, this causes an illusionary double of the cleric to spring into existence. If the cleric is being attacked, the double will absorb the first blow that lands, and disappear. At 6th level two doubles are created, and at 12th level one of the two doubles can actually wander away from the cleric to distract enemies. Mistwalkers may use this ability once per turn.

Restrictions:
- May not dual-class to fighter.
- Alignment: may not be Lawful.
~ //once per turn or five rounds?

// ... cleric of loviatar:
//
@21901  = ~paingiver of loviatar~
@21902  = ~Paingiver of Loviatar~
@21903  = ~PAINGIVER OF LOVIATAR: Known as The Maiden of Pain and The Willing Whip, Loviatar is the evil goddess of agony. She is often seen as a cold-hearted bully, calculating and despotic; she revels in inflicting physical and psychological suffering. Her priests, known simply as "Paingivers" find freedom and power in such pain, and they seek to spread that gospel to others... regardless whether their victims are actually seeking such enlightenment.

Advantages:
- Can use the Pain Touch ability at will.

PAIN TOUCH: When the priest of Loviatar activates this ability, her mere touch creates waves of pain for any creature with a nervous system.  When she touches any creature, they must save vs death or suffer a -2 penalty to their dexterity and -4 to thac0 as they writhe in agony and will suffer 1 point of non-lethal damage every 12 seconds.
The penalties and damage occurs over an excruciating period of 10 rounds.
Pain touch remains activated indefinitely, but the Paingiver may suppress it as needed.

- At 3rd level, Paingivers can use Loviatar's Caress once per day.  <PRO_HESHE> can use this ability one more time at levels 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18.

LOVIATAR'S CARESS:

When the cleric uses this ability, <PRO_HISHER> hands become instruments of Loviatar for four rounds.  <PRO_HESHE> can strike with uncanny accuracy with <PRO_HISHER> hands (+10 to hit) and <PRO_HESHE> inflicts an additional +2 points of damage per level to a maximum of +20 points at 10th level.  This spell stacks with other unarmed attacks, such as the priest's pain touch.

Restrictions:
- May not be Good.

When the cleric uses this ability, <PRO_HISHER> hands become instruments of Lovitar for four rounds.  <PRO_HESHE> can strike with uncanny accuracy with <PRO_HISHER> hands (+10 to hit) and <PRO_HESHE> inflicts an additional +2 points of damage per level to a maximum of +20 points at 10th level.  This spell stacks with other unarmed attacks, such as the priest's pain touch.~

// ... cleric of Talos:
//
@22401 = ~stormbringer of talos~
@22402 = ~Stormbringer of Talos~
@22403 = ~STORMBRINGER OF TALOS: Stormbringers are clerics of Talos, the Destroyer, the Raging One, the Stormstar, the Storm Lord.  Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive force that lies waiting to strike at any time.  Stormbringers strive to make all fear Talos by showing the destruction that he and all his servants can cause.  As examples to all, Stormbringers tend to indulge in acts of random or spiteful destruction as they travel and to make examples of all folk who stand up to them.

Advantages:
- Talos' Favor: Stormbringers are 50% resistant to electricity damage.
- Can cast Storm Shield as a special ablity once per day.  The Stormbringer gains an additional use at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

STORM SHIELD: This spell lasts 1 round per level of the caster. It protects the caster completely from lightning, fire, cold, and normal missiles.

- Can cast Lightning Bolt as a special ability once per day at 9th level.  The stormbringer gains an additional use at levels 20 and 30.  The abilty functions as the wizard spell of the same name.

Restrictions:

@22406 = ~Lightning Bolt
(Evocation)

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Path of bolt
Saving Throw: 1/2

Upon casting this spell, the cleric releases a powerful stroke of energy that inflicts 1d6 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster to each creature within its area of effect (maximum damage of 10d6). A successful Save vs. Spell reduces this damage to half (round fractions down). When the lightning bolt intersects with a wall, it will rebound until it reaches its full length - hitting the same enemy multiple times, or even members of the caster's own party.~

//
// ... cleric of Cyric:

@22501 = ~sworn of cyric~
@22502 = ~Sworn of Cyric~
@22503 = ~THE SWORN OF CYRIC: The sworn of Cyric do what they can to appease their mad, fickle god.  In the meantime, they try to take what they can, when they can, before being smited either by their god, or one of their many victims.  

Advantages:
- +1 to save vs. Illusion spells
- Sworn are completely fearless.  As such, they are not affected either by magical fear or moral failure.
- At 5th level, the Sworn can cast Confusion as the 4th level wizard spell once per day.  They can cast this spell an additional time per day at levels 10, 15 and 20.
- At 10th level, the Sworn can cast Feeblemind once per day as the wizard spell.  They gain an additional use of this ability at 20th and 30th level.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: any evil or chaotic neutral

//
@22601 = ~waverservant of umberlee~
@22602 = ~Waveservant of Umberlee~
@22603 = ~WAVESERVANT OF UMBERLEE: Umberlee is a fickle goddess who claims the sea as her sole domain.  Like many evil gods, she is more often feared than revered, though there are notable exceptions.  Umberlee has something of an...affection for lost souls, and so she has been known to take them under her wing from time to time.  

Advantages:
- Mistress of the Waves: Unlike most clerics, waveservants have focus access in the elemental water sphere.
- Can cast Smashing Wave as the cleric spell as a special ability once per day.  The Waveservant can use this ability an additional time per day at levels 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20.

Disadvantages: 
- The Waveservant cannot turn undead.

// ... priest of oghma:
//

@31001  = ~seeker of oghma~
@31002  = ~Seeker of Oghma~
@31003  = ~SEEKER OF OGHMA:  Oghma is a greater god of knowledge, sagecraft, learning, and wisdom. He is venerated by those seeking information - particularly lost or hidden information. When a Seeker demonstrates solid service or true loyalty in Oghma's cause, <PRO_HESHE> is bestowed with the title of Loremaster. This is a great honor; while outsiders may perceive the god of sages as belonging in dusty libraries, the fact is that many Oghmanite priests are of an adventuresome bent.

Advantages:
- Once per day, a Seeker can concentrate and briefly increase <PRO_HISHER> ability to understand and identify the workings of magical items.
- From 3rd level, a Seeker can innately cast Know Opponent, making it easier for <PRO_HIMHER>self and <PRO_HISHER> allies to strike the target creature.
- From 9th level, a Seeker can innately cast Feeblemind.
- Seekers can understand and use scrolls and wands normally restricted to wizards.

Restrictions:
- Alignment: May not be Evil
~
@31011  = ~Know Opponent~
@31012  = ~Know Opponent

When this spell is cast, the caster is enabled to read the aura of a target creature, and determine that creature's strengths and weaknesses. For the duration of the spell, the target's physical resistances are lowered by 10% and all attacks against the target creature are made with a +2 bonus to the attack roll. Certain magical devices negate the power of the Know Opponent spell, and the spell has no effect on creatures who don't emanate auras, such as constructs. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

// ... priest of ilmater:

@31401  = ~painbearer of ilmater~
@31402  = ~Painbearer of Ilmater~
@31403  = ~PAINBEARER OF ILMATER:  Ilmater offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, oppressed, or in great need.  He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to bear their burden and take their pain.  Painbearers are often itinerant, traveling the land looking to assuage suffering wherever it may exist. They stick to their cause if they believe it is right, whatever the pain and peril, and strive to stand up to all tyrants.

Advantages:
- Can cast remove fear at will.

@70003  = ~DRUIDS: Druids form a spiritual connection with an aspect of the natural world, and channel energy through that connection to create magical effects. This art has been practiced in some fashion since the dawn of time, some say since before there were religions or deities. Most druids are organized in ordered hierarchies in which to teach and practice their abilities. 

MYSTICS are a wild and independent sort of druid. They tend to remove themselves to remote places, in which they focus on meditating and connecting to one of the fundamental elements of the Inner Planes: earth, air, water, fire, light or darkness. The magic that flows through them is raw and powerful, but their ability to shape it is limited to effects closely related to their area of focus. Some people say Mystics are blessed by Mystra, as practitioners of the purest form of magic. The goddess herself has not given a comment on such claims.

OCCULTISTS learn to tap magical power of the universe in exotic, nontraditional ways. Through study and (often) unnatural experiments, they can learn to harness the boiling energies of the inner planes, or infernal powers from the outer planes, or the wild, animal nature seething inside every man and woman. Some have even learned to steal magical energy from the deities themselves - calling into question whether those beings are truly omnipotent.

Forests are incessantly under threat of being torn down and subjugated by careless humans and demihumans. Forest druids therefore often live with a constant low-grade paranoia, which informs the stereotype of druids being hostile to civilization.

@73104  = ~FOREST DRUID: Most druids reside in the regions where soil is nutritious, plant life is abundant and animals thrive.  These regions are in many ways the epitome of harmonious ecosystems, and druids often charge themselves with nurturing and defending them.  Tall forests are a paradise in many ways: they provide shade from the sun, food and homes for animals and people, and wood for tools.  Forests are incessantly under threat of being torn down and subjugated by careless humans and demihumans.

//
@73201  = ~totemic druid~
@73202  = ~Totemic Druid~
@73203  = ~TOTEMIC DRUID: This druid is similar in many ways to a traditional one. However, a Totemic Druid does not learn to change their shape into that of animals.

@73401  = ~hivekeeper~
@73402  = ~Hivekeeper~
@73403  = ~HIVEKEEPER: these druids maintain an interest in and affection for insectoid, arachnid, and similar animals. Such fauna play an integral role in the natural ecosystems which druids protect and revere, but they are often overlooked or even reviled by humanoids. Hivekeepers recognize and promote the productive capabilities of these animals; and they also learn utilize the potent natural weaponry that these animals have developed. Hivekeepers are often treated with some discomfort by others, and are therefore often loners. But no druids can deny their effectiveness when called up to oppose nature's enemies.

//
@73501  = ~northern druid~
@73502  = ~Northern Druid~
@73503  = ~NORTHERN DRUID: Even in the frozen tundra and on windswept mountains, life persists. Arctic druids revel in the harsh but balanced wilds in which the cold is every creature's most dangerous predator. They revel in arctic storms and learn to manipulate the forces of water and air. Through seclusion and training, they learn the importance of perseverance and determination in the face of privation and seeming hopelessness, and harness the strengths of animals that develop such perserverance naturally. This makes northern druids quite dangerous foes to those who would offend nature in the frozen north.

//
@73901  = ~lost druid~
@73902  = ~Lost Druid~
@73903  = ~LOST DRUID: Lost druids find that many other druids no longer consider them kin. Stricken by death in some traumatic way, these brooding individuals have a near-obsessive interest in the role of death in the cycles of life. They even take this as far as reanimating animal corpses and embracing necromantic magic in order to seek vengeance. This makes Lost Druids particularly dangerous, shunned by nearly everyone.

Advantages:

@76203  = ~BEAST LORD: these individuals have come to understand that within even the most rational and civilized man or woman lies an animal driven by primal needs and desires. (Often, this understanding is developed from horrifying experiments performed on subjects who are very rarely willing.) Through the application of a serum derived from a strain of lycanthropy, the Beast Lord can call forth <PRO_HISHER> own bestial nature, causing <PRO_HISHER> very body to take on lupine qualities. This also gives the Beast Lord a deep insight into magic relating to summoning and controlling animals.

@90003  = ~RANGERS: The general term 'Ranger' includes several varieties of hardy warriors which share certain characteristics: they are strong fighters, and they are skilled in stealth and scouting. In battle, rangers favor quickness and skill over brute force. They often use light, single-handed weapons, and are adept and wielding a weapon in each hand simultaneously.

SCOUTS are warriors who may not be particularly spiritual, but tend to share certain values and combat tactics with Rangers. They have very little magical abilities - generally only a couple spells connected to their particular abilities. Instead they develop skills through sheer determination, learning techniques and abilities that help them survive.

"TRUE RANGERS" are masters of their local geography, learning skills that allow them to survive in the harsh wilderness where few others could. They have access to spheres of magic relating to the environment in which they specialize, similar to druids. Rangers are generally good-natured and protective of their fellow men, using their skills to support and provide for communities in wild frontiers.

~
@95311  = ~Vocal Disruption~
@95312  = ~Vocal Disruption

Mage Hunters have learned to produce a coarse, groaning shout that is of a particular frequency that affects the inner ear of nearby spellcasters. Such spellcasters must make a saving throw vs. Petrification or be somewhat deafened and suffer a 40% chance of spell failure for 5 rounds. The effort involved in producing this sound is such that Mage Hunters cannot perform the feat very often before needing to rest their vocal cords.~

To become so skilled with the sling, the Slinger has had to sacrifice some proficiency with melee weapons and armor. 

Advantages:
- +1 to hit and damage rolls with any missile weapon every 3 levels.
- May achieve Grand Mastery (5 slots) in longbows, shortbows, and crossbows.
- May use the Called Shot ability once per day. Gains one use at level 4 and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.

Upon casting this spell, a mass of material is drawn from the environment, shaped into roughly humanoid form, and imbued with a modicum of sentience.

Upon casting this spell, the caster becomes able to move and act at a greatly increased rate.  <PRO_HISHER> overland movement rate is doubled, and <PRO_HESHE> can make an additional weapon attack each round.  (Spellcasting speed does not increase; this spell does not reduce the amount of mental concentration necessary for it.)  The spell does not make the caster any more adept at moving so fast, however, so <PRO_HESHE> suffers a -2 penalty to attack rolls while the effect is active.
