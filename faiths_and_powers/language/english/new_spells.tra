Level: 1

Range: 0
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The Caster
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster performs a short, but sacred ritual, creating holy water which <PRO_HESHE> can use <PRO_HIMHER>self or give to <PRO_HISHER> companions.  Holy water is harmful against evil outsiders and undead creatures, and mildly beneficial to living creatures.  Vials can be thrown or drunk, healing 1d4 points of damage to a living creature, or causing 2d4+2 magic damage to an undead creature or demonic outsider.
A thrown vial does no damage in itself, but breaks and affects the target creature (within 20 ft.) as below.

At 1st level, 1 vial is created.  An extra vial is created every 2 levels after that.

Holy water dissipates after 8 hours if not used.

This is a vial of water that has been sanctified by a cleric.

When the caster completes this spell and touches an allied undead ally, <PRO_HESHE> gains the ability to see through that creature's eyes allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to see everything that it sees.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> has greater influence over the creature, making it attack more effectively, granting it a +4 bonus to attack rolls.

While this spell is in effect, the caster's body is helpless, as <PRO_HESHE> is helpless, and blind, as <PRO_HISHER> consciousness is stuck in the living dead target.~

(Transmutation)

Level: 2
Sphere: Combat
Range: 25'
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: One Creature
Saving Throw: Polymorph 1/2

When the priest cast's this spell, <PRO_HESHE> creates a vibrating pulse that increases in intensity in a nearby creature or object that is especially destructive against inorganic, solid constructs like doors and golems. The first round, a living or undead creature takes 2d6 crushing damage unless they save vs. polymorph (in which case, they take half damage and the spell ends). Every round that they do not save, they suffer the amount of damage that they received in the last round, plus an additional 2d6 points of damage for a maximum of 4 rounds. Any round that they do save, they suffer 1/2 damage and the spell ends.

When cast on a door or locked container, it undermines the integrity of the object destroying all but the most sturdy or magically protected locks. Against constructs such as golems, and elementals it does double damage, and they cannot save to avoid its effects.~

A creature so commanded will stop in it's tracks, and will be unable to move if they do not make a successful save vs. spells. Even if they do make their save, creatures find that they move at 1/2 speed as their legs resist their own will.  At the end of the second round, the creature regains the use of it's legs, and can move normally.~

Level: 5
Sphere: Affliction
Range: 35 feet
Duration: Special, maximum of 3 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Poison/Death -5 see below

When the priest casts this spell, <PRO_HESHE> points to a single creature within 35 feet.  That creature is wracked with pain and must make a save vs death at -5 or be unable to move or act for a full round and they will take 2 points of non-lethal damage per level of the priest (max 30 at level 15). If he saves, he takes half damage and shakes off the spell.
In the second round, any creature that failed their save must save again or be paralyzed for another round and take the same amount of damage as they took in round one.  If they save, they take half damage and shake off the spell.
In the third round, any creature that has failed both of their previous saves must save again or remain paralyzed for another round and take the same amount of damage again.  A creature that makes a successful save will take half damage and is no longer paralyzed.
The spell ends after three rounds and does not have any affect against creatures that cannot feel pain like golems or undead.~

Range: Self
Duration: 1 Turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster

With this spell, the priest draws on the power of nature to transform <PRO_HIMHER>self into a terrible plant-like creature known as a Shambling Mound.

<PRO_HISHER> body becomes incredibly resistant to damage.  <PRO_HISHER> AC is set at 0, and <PRO_HESHE> is 50% resistant to all physical damage.  <PRO_HESHE> also becomes completely immune to fire and electricity, and only suffers half damage from cold.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> regenerates 6 hit points per round.

Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> is infused with the raw power of nature, gaining a strength of 20, and <PRO_HESHE> can make two unarmed attacks per round inflicting 2d8 (+8 from strength) damage, and those struck must make a save vs. breath or be entangled for two rounds.

These unarmed attacks count as +3 weapons.

The wrath of nature will not be restrained.  The priest is protected by freedom of action while transformed.

<PRO_HESHE> loses the ability to cast spells while transformed.~

(Alteration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Plant
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 24-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about any creatures within the area of effect, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Additionally, they try to squeeze the life out of any creature caught in their grasp, causing 4d6 points of crushing damage per round.  A successful Save vs. breath avoids entanglement, and halves the damage inflicted, though creatures in the area are still impeded, and find their movement halved. Entangled creatures can still attack, even though they cannot move.

Note: The spell Free Action protects recipients against damage and movement penalties from this spell.~

Upon casting a Conjure Water Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Water, and a water elemental is summoned in the vicinity of the caster. There is a 60% chance that a 12-Hit-Dice elemental appears; a 35% chance that a 16-Hit-Dice elemental appears; and a 5% chance that a 24-Hit-Dice elemental appears. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike Mages, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.~

The spell sends out frost jets of 5 ft. length in a horizontal arc of about 120 degrees in front of the caster. Any creature in the area receives 1d6 points of cold damage, plus 1d6 per two levels to a maximum of 5d6 damage.~
