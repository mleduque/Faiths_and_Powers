Area of Effect: The Caster  
Saving Throw: None

With this spell, the caster performs a short, but sacred ritual, creating holy water which <PRO_HESHE> can use <PRO_HIMHER>self or give to <PRO_HISHER> companions.  Holy water is harmful against evil outsiders and undead creatures, and mildly beneficial to living creatures.  Vials can be thrown or drunk, healing 1d4 points of damage to a living creature, or causing 2d4+2 magic damage to an undead creature or demonic outsider.
A thrown vial does no damage in itself, but breaks and affects the target creature (within 20 ft.) as below.

At 1st level, 1 vial is created.  An extra vial is created every 2 levels after that.

Holy water dissipates after 8 hours if not used.

Area of Effect: One Creature
Saving Throw: Polymorph 1/2

When the priest cast's this spell, <PRO_HESHE> creates a vibrating pulse that increases in intensity in a nearby creature or object that is especially destructive against inorganic, solid constructs like doors and golems. The first round, a living or undead creature takes 2d6 crushing damage unless they save vs. polymorph (in which case, they take half damage and the spell ends). Every round that they do not save, they suffer the amount of damage that they received in the last round, plus an additional 2d6 points of damage for a maximum of 4 rounds. Any round that they do save, they suffer 1/2 damage and the spell ends.

When cast on a door or locked container, it undermines the integrity of the object destroying all but the most sturdy or magically protected locks. Against constructs such as golems, and elementals it does double damage, and they cannot save to avoid its effects.~

Saving Throw: Poison/Death -5 see below

When the priest casts this spell, <PRO_HESHE> points to a single creature within 35 feet.  That creature is wracked with pain and must make a save vs death at -5 or be unable to move or act for a full round and they will take 2 points of non-lethal damage per level of the priest (max 30 at level 15). If he saves, he takes half damage and shakes off the spell.
In the second round, any creature that failed their save must save again or be paralyzed for another round and take the same amount of damage as they took in round one.  If they save, they take half damage and shake off the spell.
In the third round, any creature that has failed both of their previous saves must save again or remain paralyzed for another round and take the same amount of damage again.  A creature that makes a successful save will take half damage and is no longer paralyzed.

Level: 6
Sphere: Plant
Range: Self
Duration: 1 Turn
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster

With this spell, the priest draws on the power of nature to transform <PRO_HIMHER>self into a terrible plant-like creature known as a Shambling Mound.

<PRO_HISHER> body becomes incredibly resistant to damage.  <PRO_HISHER> AC is set at 0, and <PRO_HESHE> is 50% resistant to all physical damage.  <PRO_HESHE> also becomes completely immune to fire and electricity, and only suffers half damage from cold.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> regenerates 6 hit points per round.

Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> is infused with the raw power of nature, gaining a strength of 20, and <PRO_HESHE> can make two unarmed attacks per round inflicting 2d8 (+8 from strength) damage, and those struck must make a save vs. breath or be entangled for two rounds.

These unarmed attacks count as +3 weapons.

The wrath of nature will not be restrained.  The priest is protected by freedom of action while transformed.

<PRO_HESHE> loses the ability to cast spells while transformed.~

Area of Effect: 24-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast, grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about any creatures within the area of effect, holding them fast for the duration of the spell. Additionally, they try to squeeze the life out of any creature caught in their grasp, causing 4d6 points of crushing damage per round.  A successful Save vs. breath avoids entanglement, and halves the damage inflicted, though creatures in the area are still impeded, and find their movement halved. Entangled creatures can still attack, even though they cannot move.

Note: The spell Free Action protects recipients against damage and movement pentalties from this spell.~

All the commands given to the elemental are done telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication and no need to know the language of the summoned creature. Unlike Mages, priests do not have to engage in a battle of the minds to control their elemental.~

Sphere: Elemental Earth
Range: Personal
Duration: Instant: 2 turns
Casting Time: 0
Saving Throw: None  

This spell changes the coloration of the caster to match the surrounding environment, making <PRO_HIMHER> very difficult to see.

When this spell is cast, the caster gains a +50% bonus to hide and move silently, and <PRO_HESHE> naturally blends in to the surrounding environment, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to hide as a thief or ranger for the duration.

This bonus increases by +5% at 2nd level, and +5% per 2 levels after that, to a maximum of +75% at 10th level.~

@53024 = ~This bullet looks more like an egg than a proper bullet, and it seems to contain some kind of powder.  Indeed, it is designed to burst open at the slightest impact, coating the target with that powder.  The bullet itself doesn't do much damage--targets take 1 point--but the target must save vs. poison or choke on the fumes, suffering 1 point of poison damage per second, and is penalized for -1 to AC for 6 seconds.

This bullet is not well balanced, and it is difficult to shoot accuracy.  As such, it imposes a -2 penalty to hit.

This bullet strikes as a +1 weapon.

Duration: Special
Casting Time: 9

This alarm awakens the caster and <PRO_HISHER> allies, and makes them alert to all enemies, giving them a +2 bonus to weapon and casting speed for a single round.  This spell cannot be cast in the presence of enemies.  

Once the ward is set, it protects the caster and <PRO_HISHER> allies as long as they stay within the general area.  The ward lasts for 8 hours or until triggered.~

When <PRO_HESHE> casts this spell, <PRO_HESHE> has a chance to detect traps equal to 30%, +5% for each additional level after first (max 75% at level 10) for one hour.  <PRO_HESHE> need not take a special action, <PRO_HESHE> will automatically look for traps for the duration as long as this spell is in effect, and <PRO_HESHE> is not doing anything else.

This chance to detect spells stacks with any preexisting skill the mage might otherwise have with detect traps, and if <PRO_HESHE> has levels in thief, this spell will give <PRO_HIMHER> a bonus to disarm traps as well.~

This spell turns the caster invisible and makes <PRO_HIMHER> undetectable by normal vision or infravision. The spell remains in effect for 1 round, +1 round per 2 levels after 1st, level (max 5 rounds at levl 9), until it is magically broken or dispelled, or until the recipient talks to or attacks any creature. Thus, the invisible being can open doors, eat, climb stairs, etc., but if <PRO_HESHE> attacks or casts a spell, <PRO_HESHE> immediately becomes visible (although the invisibility enables <PRO_HIMHER> to attack first).~

@67401 = ~Charm Monster~
@67402 = ~Charm Monster
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell affects any single person or monster it is cast upon. The term monster includes any non-undead, non-construct, non-extraplanar creature, such as an ogre or even a dragon.  The target is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect (a person, as described by charm person, saves at -4).

If the spell's recipient fails <PRO_HISHER> Saving Throw, <PRO_HESHE> regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give him orders, and the charmed individual will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harm or attempts to harm the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed creature, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject has full memory of the events that took place while he was charmed. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where he is charmed.~

@67410 = ~Mindsight~
@67411 = ~Mindsight
(Divination)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: the caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster is able to "see" and "hear" everything in <PRO_HISHER> immediate area, as though the environmental conditions are ideal for sight and sound, and <PRO_HESHE> can effectively "see" twice as far as before.  <PRO_HESHE> needs no sensory organs for this detection, and, as such, effects that blind or deafen are effectively dispelled.  Additionally, <PRO_HESHE> need not fear such effects as long as this spell is in place.

<PRO_HESHE> effectively gains infravision while this spell is in effect, and <PRO_HISHER> preternatural awareness of <PRO_HISHER> surroundings grants a -2 bonus to <PRO_HISHER> armor class.

This spell does not grant any special benefits against illusions.~

(Evocation)

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

@67503 = ~Usurp Shell~
@67504 = ~Usurp Shell
(Necromancy)

Level: 5
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Special

With this spell the caster attempts to bypass the targets mind, taking direct control of their body instead if they do not make a save vs. death -2.  Unlike a dominate spell, this spell does not touch the mind, and can even be used to usurp the body of an undead creature, or any creature with biological anatomy.

If this spell is sucessful, the caster gains control of the targets body, allowing <PRO_HIMHER> to make the body attack or move as <PRO_HESHE> pleases. <PRO_HESHE> does not gain fine motor control of the tergets body, however, nor does <PRO_HESHE> gain control of the targets mind. Thus, <PRO_HESHE> cannot force the target to cast spells or use special abilities on <PRO_HISHER> behalf.

Additionally, the targets movements are jerky and predicable, and they move at 80% their normal speed and suffer a -2 to all attack rolls. 

If the target resists the spell, they suffer 3d8 points of magic damage.~

@67505 = ~Body Controlled!~


@68000 = ~Siphon Vitality~
@68001 = ~Siphon Vitality
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: 15 ft.
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When the caster casts this spell and points to a creature within 15', that creature is drained for 1d8 points of magic damage per 3 levels (maximum 6d8 at 18th level). These Hit Points are added to the caster's total as a temporary bonus that lasts for 1 hour.  The caster is also revitalized, gaining a +1 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and moral.  This spell has no effect on constructs or undead.

A caster cannot benefit from multiple castings of Siphon Vitality.~

@68002 = ~A siphon vitality spell is already active!~
